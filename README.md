# Business Insights 360

## üìå Project Overview

AtliQ Hardware is a rapidly growing company that has decided to adopt data analytics to gain a competitive advantage. This Power BI project enables stakeholders to derive key insights across **Finance**, **Sales**, **Marketing**, and **Supply Chain** to drive data-informed decisions.

This end-to-end dashboard was built by following the [Codebasics Power BI Course](https://codebasics.io/courses/power-bi-data-analysis-with-end-to-end-project), where concepts were implemented step-by-step from raw data to insights.

üéØ **Main Goal**: Help AtliQ Hardware move away from intuition-based decisions and enable data-driven strategies for growth and optimization.
